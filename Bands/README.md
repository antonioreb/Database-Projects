# Bands Database Project

This project was done in the context of the Advanced Databases course from the Faculty of Science from the University of Lisbon. The goal was to implement and test databases that contain information about bands both in a document-oriented database and a RDBMS.

The project is divided in three parts:

1. **Design and implementation of a Bands database in PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Design of two complex queries in both databases:** 
    * Data preprocessing and insertion in the databases.
    * ER and schema design. 
    * Comparison between PostgreSQL and MongoDB 
2. **Concurrency problems in PostgreSQL**:
    * Study of different types of anomolies that may come up.
    * Study of different types of solutions to said anomalies like using locks or different isolation levels.
3. **Database tunning and optimization**
    * Consideration of changes in data modelling approach both in MongoDB and PostgreSQL to increase performance.
    * Different indexation strategies implemented and compared.
    * Query rewriting to improve performance.

The reports contain most of the analysis and the code, while the folder "Part1-files" includes the data pre-processing and other code that was made to implement the databases.

The final grade of this project was 19.5/20
